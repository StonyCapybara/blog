# Proof that \\(2 \gt 1\\)

### This is a geometrical proof that uses the [triangle inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality)

We start by considering an arbitrary triangle ABC with lengths \\(AB = c,\text{ } BC = a,\text{ } CA = b\\)

By the triangle in equality, we can set up the three following equations:
\\[a + b \gt c\\]
\\[b + c \gt a\\]
\\[c + a \gt b\\]

Now, adding all three equations:
\\[2(a + b + c) \gt a + b + c \\]
\\[\implies 
  \frac{2\cancel{(a + b + c)}}{\cancel{(a + b + c)}}
  \gt
  \frac{\cancel{(a + b + c)}}{\cancel{(a + b + c)}}
\\]
\\[\implies \boxed{2 \gt 1}\\]
