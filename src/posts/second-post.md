# Welcome to my second post!

In this post, I am going to calculate the value of \\(\int_{-\frac{\pi}2}^{\frac{\pi}2} \cos x dx\\)

To evalute the following integral, we need to take the antiderivative of \\(\cos x\\) which is just \\(\sin x\\)

Now we need to calclate the value of
\\[ [\sin x ]_{-\frac{\pi}2}^{\frac{\pi}2}\\]

\\[ = \sin(\frac{\pi}2) - \sin(\frac{-\pi}2)\\]
\\[ = 1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\\]
